{\bf Mobility and science.}

As scholars move, they bring their knowledge, skills, and social connections with them---collectively the movements of researchers shape the structure and direction of the global scientific enterprise.
For example, prestige-driven mobility between doctoral-granting and employing institution is highly unequal~\autocite{clauset2015hierarchy, deville2014career}, which affects the diffusion of ideas across academia~\autocite{morgan2018prestige}.
By placing researchers in new social settings, mobility can lead to the formation of new collaborative relationships~\autocite{rodrigues2016mobility}, which in turn spurs the further diffusion of knowledge and innovations~\autocite{braunerhjelm2020labor, azoulay2011diffusion, kaiser2018innovation, armano2017innovation}.
Perhaps resulting from the selection effects of who gets to move, or the reconfiguring of social and epistemic networks, movement is associated with increased scientific impact~\autocite{sugimoto2017mostimpact, petersen2018multiscale, jonkers2013return, franzoni2014advantage}.
At the national level, the understanding of mobility has progressed beyond simplistic narratives of brain drain and brain gain, and instead adopts a new perspective of \textit{flows} of talent~\autocite{meyer2001network, ioannidis2014braindrain, gaillard1998circulation}.
Under this flow model, a mobile researcher is viewed as contributing to both their origin and destination countries, a perspective that fosters that is evidenced by the strong science of open countries~\autocite{wagner2017open}.
Perhaps because of these individual and national benefits, policy-makers have come to recognize the importance of global mobility~\autocite{box2008competition, oecd2010innovation}.
Movement is a key mechanism that has clear impacts on the composition and direction of the global scientific workforce and our collective scientific understanding.
Understanding the structure and dynamics of mobility is thus essential for understanding global science.

{\bf Modeling scientific mobility.}

There are many ways of modeling scientific mobility from bibliographic data, the first consideration being the unit of analysis.
Most studies of mobility have focused on \textit{country-level} mobility--the flows of researchers across nations~\autocite{sugimoto2017mostimpact, scellato2015migrant, robinson-garcia2018indicators, franzoni2012foreign-born}.
Practically, country-level analyses benefit from higher reliability, such that idiosyncrasies and errors inherent to bibliographic databases are mitigated by this higher level of aggregation.
Epistemically, country-level analysis is useful for national science governance who aims to understand the status of their country in the global landscape and make informed policy decisions.
Analyses at lower levels of analysis are far less common.
\textit{Regional}-level scientific mobility--the flow of researchers between regions or cities within or across countries has been only minimally studied~\autocite{vaccario2019mobility}, possibly due to lack of reliable long-term data and lack of policy relevance to national-level lawmakers.
\textit{Organization}-level mobility has the potential to inform institutional policy and to understand the composition of mobility within a single country or region, especially as it relates to organization performance, prestige, and inequality~\autocite{albarran2017topeconomic, deville2014career, morgan2018prestige, clauset2015hierarchy}.
However, affiliation disambiguation and noise in bibliometric data makes large-scale organization-level analysis challenging.
Here, we learn neural-network embeddings of scientific mobility at the level of organizations using a curated bibliographic database.
These embeddings are robust to noise, and so are capable of representing clear structure even amid issues with organizational disambiguation.
In doing so, embeddings also capture a more detailed understanding of mobility than has been previously studied.


Another consideration when analyzing scientific mobility is what kinds of mobility to study.
Typical understandings of mobility are directional: movement is always \textit{from} one place and \textit{to} another.
However, scientific mobility is more complicated.
For example, scientists often hold multiple affiliations at a time~\autocite{markova2016synchronous}, listing them as co-affiliations on a single paper, or even choosing a subset of affiliations to use fohabeultiple simultaneous projects~\autocite{robinson2019mobility}.
Even clearly-directional migration to another institution is complex--researchers may continue to publish with an old affiliation for projects that began before their move, and they may maintain social and organizational links to their old institution (e.g., collaborators, projects, graduate students) such that there is no clear breakage after migrating.
There is also a whole range of short-term scientific mobility, such as visiting scholarships and short-term visits that are only visible through intensive efforts such as manual extraction from CVs~\autocite{woolley2009cv, sandstrom2009cv, canibano2011temporary}.
Here, we focus on more long-term mobility that can be derived from bibliographic data.
Due to the complexity of scientific mobility, we make the simplifying assumption that all scientific mobility is \textit{symmetric} or without direction such that any move from an organization $A$ to organization $B$ is equivalent to a move from $B$ to $A$.
By assuming non-directional mobility, all mobility events are commensurate, meaning that they can be treated identically in our analysis--this allows us to represent the complexity of mobility without making decisions about the directional of their mobility or which is their main affiliation.
Moreover, this assumption has the practical advantage of matching the data format expected by the \textit{word2vec} model, as well as the theoretical advantage of adhering to the symmetricity assumption of the gravity model of mobility.

{\bf Building affiliation trajectories.}

For each mobile researcher who has at least two distinct affiliations, we construct an affiliation trajectory based on the affiliations listed on their published papers indexed in the Web of Science database between 2008 and 2019.
An author is considered mobile if they published with at least two distinct affiliations during the time period of study.
Affiliation names were manually disambiguated, and each was mapped to a unique organization identifier.
An affiliation trajectory for an individual researcher is a sequence of organizations in ascending order of year of publication.
If a researcher published papers with affiliation $A$ in year $t$, $B$ in $t+1$, $C$ in $t+2$ and $A$ again in $t+3$, then the affiliation trajectory is expressed as $(A, B, C, A)$.

In the case that an individual lists multiple affiliations in a single year, affiliations listed on publications published in that year are shuffled between each iteration of the \textit{word2vec} training process (each epoch).
For example, an author who published with affiliation $A$ in $t_{0}$, and affiliations $B$ and $C$ in $t_{1}$ could appear as one of $(A, B, C)$ or $(A, C, B)$ in each training iteration.
This effectively removes the effect of order within a year, as the order cannot be meaningfully established based on co-affiliations in a single paper, or on different affiliations listed on separate papers, for which its date of publication may not be representative of the actual completion of the project.

Other than restricting to only mobile researchers, we do not perform any filtering or reductions to affiliation trajectories.
In the case than an author publishes with organization $A$ four times in $t_{0}$, and affiliation $B$ two times in $t_{1}$, then their trajectory will be $(A, A, A, A, B, B)$.
Although mobile authors who publish more papers will have longer trajectories, \textit{word2vec} will skip duplicate consecutive organization IDs, mitigating the impact of long repetitive trajectories.

{\bf Network-based personalized page rank distances.}


We examine the gravity model on the Personalized Page Rank (PPR)\autocite{jeh2003scaling} as a benchmark on the network. We construct the co-occurrence network of $N$ organizations, in which each edge between organizations $i$ and $j$ represents a co-occurence of $i$ and $j$ in the same affiliation trajectory, with weight $W_{ij}$ given by the sum of the co-occurences over all researchers. and edges are co-occurrence between two organizations. The Personalized Page Rank is a ranking algorithm for nodes based on a random walk process on networks. 
The walker visiting at a node moves to a neighboring node chosen randomly with a probability proportionally to the weight of the edge in one step. Furthermore, with probability $\alpha$, the walker is teleported back to the starting node. The rank of a node is determined by the probability that the walker visits the node in the stationary state. The stationary distribution of the random walker starting from node $i$, denoted by $p_i=(p_{ik})$, is given by 

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:ppr}
	p_i = (1 - \alpha) v_i + \alpha p_i W,
\end{equation}
where $v_i$ is a column vector of length $N$ with entries that are all zero except the $i$th entry that equals to one, $W = (W_{ij})$ is the weighted adjacency matrix. We used $\alpha=0.9$ here.

 We can think $p_i$ as a representation vector of the organization $i$, and calculate the distance between organizations $i$ and $j$, $d_{ij}$ with measuring distance between $p_i$ and $p_j$ to examine the gravity law. We consider two distance measures in this analysis. The first one is cosine distance which is used for our embedding method, $d_{ij} = 1 - \frac{\bm{p}_{i} \cdot \bm{p}_{j}}{\lVert \bm{p}_{i} \rVert \lVert \bm{p}_{j} \rVert}$. Also, if we think $p_i$ as a discrete probability distribution, then we can consider Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD), can be written as,

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:JSD}
	d_{ij} = JSD(p_i||p_j) = \frac{1}{2}D_{KL}(p_i||m) + \frac{1}{2}D_{KL}(p_j||m),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:KL}
	D_{KL}(p_i||m) = \sum^x p_{ix}\log\frac{p_{ix}}{m_x},
\end{equation}
where $m=\frac{1}{2}(p_i+p_j)$. We report the result with cosine distance ($R^2=0.14$, Fig. \ref{fig:supp:gravity_pprcos}) and  Jensen–Shannon divergence ($R^2=0.19$, Fig. \ref{fig:supp:gravity_pprjsd}). In both cases, the performance is under the performance of the model with geographical distance. Even though the length of the PPR vectors is extremely larger than the length of our embedding vectors, result with the embedding distance outperforms both of them.

{\bf Organization disambiguation and metadata.}

Affiliations mapped to one of 8,661 organizations, disambiguated following that originally designed for the Leiden Rankings of World Universities~\autocite{waltman2012leidenrankings}.
Organizational records were associated with a full name, a type indicating the sector (e.g., University, Government, Industry), and an identifier for the country and city of the organization.
Sixteen different sector types were included in the analysis, which we aggregated to four high-level codes: \textit{University}, \textit{Hospital}, \textit{Government}, and \textit{Other}.
Each record was also associated with a latitude and longitude. 
However, for many organizations, these geographic coordinates were missing or incorrect. 
We manually updated the coordinates of 2,267 organizations by searching the institution name and city on Google Maps;
in cases where a precise location of the organization could not be identified, we used the coordinates returned when searching the name of the city.
The data was further enriched with country-level information, including region, most widely-spoken language, and its language family (e.g., the language family of \textit{Spanish} is \textit{Italic}).
State/province-level information was added using the reverse geocoding service LocationIQ using each organization's latitude and longitude as input.
Regional census classifications were added for states in the United States.
For each organization, we calculated size as the average number of unique authors (mobile and non-mobile) who published with that organization across each year of our dataset;
in the case that authors publish with multiple affiliations in a single year, they are counted towards each.


As a result of our disambiguation procedure, some affiliations are mapped to two organizations, one specific, and one more general.
For example, any author affiliated with ``Indiana University Bloomington'' will also be listed as being affiliated with the ``Indiana University System'', a more general designation for all public universities in Indiana.
However, a more general organization may not always occur alongside the more specific one.
For example, a researcher affiliated with the smaller regional school ``Indiana University South Bend'' will be listed as affiliated with only the ``Indiana University System''.
We identify all specific organizations that always co-occur along with a more general one.
For every career trajectory that includes one of these specific organizations, we remove all occurrences of the more general organization;
trajectories containing only a general designation are not altered.

{\bf Author name dismabiguation.}

Author-name disambiguation, the problem of associating names on papers with individuals authors, remains difficult for the use of bibliometric data~\autocite{dangelo2020disambiguation}.
Authors in our dataset have been disambiguated using a rule-based algorithm that makes use of author and paper metadata, such as physical addresses, co-authors, and journal, to score papers on the likelihood of belonging to an author cluster---a cluster of publications believed to have been authored by the same individual~\autocite{caron2014disambiguation}.
We limit our period of analysis to the period of 2008 to 2019, as in 2008 the Web of Science began indexing additional author-level metadata such as full names and email addresses.
The disambiguation algorithm is conservative, favoring splitting clusters over merging.
Past studies have validated this data and shown that the disambiguated authors are comparable to ground-truth records such as those from ORCID and useful for a wide range of bibliometric studies~\autocite{sugimoto2017mostimpact, robinson2019mobility, chinchilla2018global, chinchilla2018travelban}.

{\bf Reconstructing Times ranking with network measure.}

The performance of the embedding ranking in reconstructing the Times ranking is comparable to that of network-derived measures such as degree strength (Spearman's $\rho = 0.73$, Fig.~\ref{fig:supp:centrality_times_compare}a) and eigencentrality centrality (Spearman's $\rho = 0.76$, Fig.~\ref{fig:supp:centrality_times_compare}b).
However, while both embedding- and network-based measures relate to university prestige, they are qualitatively and quantitatively different.
The embedding-ranking of U.S. universities is less correlated with degree strength (Spearman's $\rho = 0.45$, Fig.~\ref{fig:supp:centrality_semaxis_compare}a) and eigenvector  centrality (Spearman's $\rho = 0.55$) than with the Times ranking itself (Spearman's $\rho = 0.73$, Fig.~\ref{fig:supp:centrality_semaxis_compare}b). 
The embedding ranking over-ranks large research-intensive universities such as North Carolina State University, University of Florida, and Texas A\&M University, whereas the network-derived ranking over-ranks smaller, more specialized universities such as Brandeis University, Yeshiva University, and University of San Francisco. 
This suggests that the embedding encodes information on prestige hierarchy at least as well as a network representation, with some noticeable qualitative differences.

\label{si:text:boomerang_speculation}
{\bf Speculation on variations of the convex-curve pattern.}

The convex-curve pattern observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:length} repeats across many countries, with variations.
For example, the representative vector of Chinese organizations has a larger norm than that of the U.S. ($\bar{l} = 2.97$ vs $\bar{l} = 2.39$, Table~\ref{table:supp:norm}), causing its curve to be shifted upwards with a larger peak vector norm;
this may reflect a tendency for organizations in the U.S. to appear more frequently in different contexts than Chinese organizations.
Other nations such as Poland, Iran, and Turkey show a linear relationship between an organization's number of researchers and the vector norm, indicating that their largest organizations belong to very specific contexts (Fig.~\ref{fig:concave30}).
The organization-level distribution of vector norms reveals deeper heterogeneity.
The distribution of the vector norms for the U.S. is relatively skewed, suggesting their large norm is driven by a small and tight community of organizations (\textit{skew}$ = -0.82$, Fig.~\ref{fig:norm_dist}).
Germany and the U.K. have comparable representative vector norms to the U.S. ($\bar{l} = 2.6$ and $\bar{l} = 2.61$, respectively), with lower skewness (\textit{skew}$ = -0.63$ and \textit{skew}$ = -0.55$), suggesting more tight community of organizations.
The vector norms of organizations in some countries are even more skewed, such as in Iran ($\bar{l} = 3.57$, \textit{skew}$ = -2.13$) and China ($\bar{l} = 2.97$, \textit{skew}$ = -1.08$), indicating the strong difference between their most- and least-connected organizations.
For some countries, their organizations are positively-skewed, though seemingly for different reasons.
For example, Austria has a balanced distribution of organization vector norms, suggesting a diverse range of organizations with most being well connected ($\bar{l} =2.64$, $s = 0.18$);
Russia, in contrast, has a number of organization vectors of moderate norms, but also several isolated organizations with large vector norms ($\bar{l} = 3.08$, $s = 0.67$).

		\textbf{Distribution of organization embedding vector norms by country.}
		Histogram showing the distribution of L2 norm values of organization embedding vectors in each of the 30 countries with the largest number of total unique mobile and non-mobile researchers.
		Text in each panel shows the number of organizations in the country (n) and the GINI index of inequality of the distribution (g);
		a small GINI index indicates that the L2 norms of organizations are more balanced, whereas a high GINI value indicates that they are more unequal.
